# Functions of Several Variables

## What is $f(x,y)$  ?
### Definition
Functions whose input is more than one variable are called as multi-variable functions. They are usually represented by $ f(x,y) $ or $ f(x,y,z) $ .
Functions that take one or more variable as input and returns scalar  values as output are called as scalar valued functions.
Example:  $ f(x) = \sin x  $ , $ f(x,y) = \sin x + \ cos y $ ,  $ f(x,y,z) = x^{2}y + y^{3} + z $ 
Some functions return vectors as outputs. These functions are called as vector valued functions.
Example: $ f(x)=\left[\begin{array}{c}{\cos (x)} \\ {\sin (x)}\end{array}\right] $ , $ f(x,y)=\left[\begin{array}{c}{x^2y} \\ {xy}\end{array}\right] $

### Motivation
Multivariate functions play an integral role both in mathematical theory and in practical applications. It can be pretty intimidating when the familiar $f(x)$ in the high-school turns to something complex involving many variables. A through understanding of how the functions of several variables work is very essential in understanding the mathematical part of almost all fields like physics, economics,chemistry,computer science, etc. This is important because unlike theory most real life phenomena are effected by more than one variable and representing them in mathematical terms requires the use of multivariable functions. A very simple example that can be considered in this aspect is that price of things is a function of the demand for them, supply of the goods and the price of other goods in the same category.

### Bird's Eye View
Multivariable functions can be understood as just regular functions the difference being that multivariate functions take more than one input or give more than one output.

These functions can be explored from two perspectives of how they are represented on paper and how they look when they are plotted.

### Scalar vs Vector Valued functions
To understand the difference between scalar and vector functions a firm grasp on the basics of what the concepts of scalars and vectors mean is very essential. 
Scalars are the quantities that have only a magnitude(i.e. value) associated with them where as vectors are defined by multiple scalars. Vectors are usually seen as quantities that have both a magnitude and a direction. 
For Example:
$2$ and $3$ are scalars where as ($2, 3$) is a vector, which is made up of two scalar quantities of  $2$ and $3$

We generally deal with scalar functions in our day to day math. These are functions that take one or more inputs and return a scalar quantity.

For example $f(x) = x^{2}+2x $
Unlike scalar functions,we do not encounter vector functions in our day to day lives at least on the surface level but they extensively used in the fields of computer science and physics. These functions take in one or more inputs and return more than one output. 
For example $ f(x)=\left[\begin{array}{c}{x+1} \\ {x^3 + 3x^2}\end{array}\right] $

### Graphical Representation
Multivariate functions are plotted similarly to single variable functions but these are plotted on more dimensions than the single variable functions.
For example a two variable scalar function $f(x,y)$ is plotted on a 3D space with the $x,y,z$ axes. For a scalar function of this form the inputs are plotted on the x and the y axis whereas the output is plotted on the z axis. Together this gives us a plot in the 3D space. The plots of scalar functions are surfaces on the three dimensional plane.

Example of Scalar function plot:

Vector functions also can be plotted in the same way as the scalar functions of more than one variable. When the input is considered in one axis and the two outputs are plotted on the other two axes. For example a vector function $f(x)= [\sin x , \cos x]$. For a vector function of this form the outputs are plotted on the x and the y axis whereas the input is plotted on the z axis. Together this gives us a plot in the 3D space. Vector functions can be divided into parametric equations before plotting on the three dimensional surface.

### Pause and Ponder
Let's take a moment to consider these questions
* How will the domains and co-domains of functions of several variables look?
* How will a function of this form be plotted $f(x,y,z)=x^2+2x+1$?
* What are some examples that these functions can represent in real life?

### Applications
Let's look at some applications of the functions of several variables 
* Mathematical models of real world problems are usually function so f more than one variable as real world thigns are seldom dependent on only one thing.
* Multivariate functions form the foundation for the whole field of multi-variable calculus upon which many concepts of physics and economics are built 
* Vector functions form the basis for analyzing the motion of objects in more than one dimension.
### Historical Note
The first recorded usage of the word "scalar" in mathematics occurred in François Viète's Analytic Art in 1591.However, the first abstraction of the basic idea of a vector was done by Giusto Bellavitis was only done in the year 1835. These concepts evolved gradually over a period of 200 years with significant contributions by many people.
