    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before discussing the essence of uniform convergence and continuity/differentiation, we need to understand the difference between Pointwise and Uniform convergence. <br>\n",
    "Convergence implies that a sequence of function ${f_n}$ tends to a function $f$ at very large values of $n$. \\\\\\\\\n",
    "In simple words, Pointwise convergence means that, at every point the sequence of functions has its own speed of convergence (that can be very fast at some points and very very very very slow at others).\n",
    " \\\\\\\\\n",
    "Consequently, Uniform convergence means there is an overall speed of convergence.\\\\\n",
    "(output1.mp4)\\\\\n",
    "Pointwise convergence is ideally the most natural way to define convergence, but it does not behave in the manner one might initially expect. For example, if a sequence of function is bounded, the pointwise convergence might not preserve its boundedness. \\\\\\\\\n",
    "Similar is the situation when we talk about continuity. If $f_n$ is a continuous function and is pointwise convergent to $f$, we cannot be sure that f is also continuous.\n",
    "It is illustrated through the following example. \\\\\n",
    "(output2.mp4)\n",
    "(Animation)\\\\\\\\\n",
    "\\newline\n",
    "Here, we can visualise the importance of Uniform Convergence which is well behaved as was expected from Pointwise convergence. It usually preserves the properties of the sequence of function under consideration.\n",
    "\\section{Bird’s Eye View}\n",
    "One of the most important property of uniform convergence is that it preserves continuity. It follows that uniform convergence is sufficient for preserving continuity. However, it is not necessary, that is, f being continuous does not imply that $f_n$ converges uniformly to $f$.\\\\\n",
