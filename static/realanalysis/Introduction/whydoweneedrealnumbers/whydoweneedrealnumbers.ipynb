    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a mind-boggling, yet rewarding task to contemplate the relationship between geometric length and arithmetic magnitude. Have you ever given it much thought? In the time of the Greeks, the prevailing number system was limited to the rational numbers. With this numerical structure, they were able to satisfactorily carry out measurements, but every once in a while, they would hit a wall. \n",
    "Take for example a square with area 2. We are aware that the area of a square is equal to its side multiplied to itself. However, there is no rational number whose square is equal to 2. \n",
    "​\n",
    "Essentially, the Greeks realised that not all ratios were commensurable, i.e. it was not always possible to find a third length that could be used to express the lengths that made up the ratio. Their number system was irreconcilable with incommensurability, and hence, they abandoned algebra for geometry, for compared to number, length was a better established, more concrete concept in their minds.\n",
    "​\n",
    "But how is it possible for $\\sqrt{2}$ to exist as a geometric length and not a number? \n",
    "​\n",
    "What follows is a geometrical proof that demonstrates that $\\sqrt{2}$ doesn't belong in $\\mathbb{Q}$. This particular proof is credited to the Princeton mathematician Stanley Tennenbaum.\n"

    "\n",
    "How does one work around this limitation of the rationals? By constructing the real numbers, of course! To do so, we will use the concept of Dedekind Cuts. Using a Dedekind Cut, a real number is represented as a spot at which the number line has been _cut_ with an infinitely thin knife. Neat, isn't it?! Note, however, that this cut is not a gap between two individual rational numbers, rather, it is a gap between _two sets of rational numbers_ . What's remarkable about the Dedekind Cuts is the fact that it allows us to define a real number purely in terms of the rationals. \n"

Perhaps the most famous, and arguably one of the most elegant proofs in pure mathematics is that of $\\sqrt{2}$ is not rational as it appears in Book X of Euclid's Elements. \n"
